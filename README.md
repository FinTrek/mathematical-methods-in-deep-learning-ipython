# mathematical-methods-in-deep-learning
Python code (in the form of Jupyter ipython notebooks) to support the book
"Mathematical Methods in Deep Learning" (Krishnendu Chaudhury, Ananya Ashok Honnedevasthana,
Sujay Narumanchi, Devashish Shankar).
This repository contains the example code - mostly in Numpy and PyTorch - corresponding to
the theoretical topics introduced in the book. The code listings are organized in chapters
that correspond to the main book.
